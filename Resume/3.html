            I'm going to take the exam to be a public official. I heard that it is hardly find the human resource who has a career in "Programming" in the government office.<br>
            And also, I think that it is important to have <u>Programming Skills</u> because of the changes of this generation.<br>
            So, like English, I want to use this language to make and give public services to the people who live in the whole different world than before.<br>
            To do that, I have to study my major, Public Administration, and also programming languages to be the resource.</div>
